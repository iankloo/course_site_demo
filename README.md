# Course Website Concept Demo

This site is a shell that could be used as the main web resource for a course.  

### Design principles:

1. Aesthetically pleasing and professional appearance
    - Communication is more than just providing access to information
    - If folder-based structures (Blackboard, Teams, etc.) are "good enough", why do all of the websites we visit frequently not just have a folder structure?
    - Folder-based course sites communicate to students that we are doing the minimum for class prep (even when that isn't true).
2. Reduces number of clicks for students to get to content
    - All course material for each lesson should be available in one place.
    - It shouldn't take long for students to access multiple lessons (e.g., when studying for a test)
3. All course resources available and their locations obvious
    - Course resources like the syllabus and instructor information should be up-front and easy to access
4. Open source and platform agnostic
    - Using for-profit software means we depend on external developers to make products that work for us
    - Shifting between platforms can be difficult
    - Open source tools are prevalent and well-maintained in the academic space
5. Incorporates version control
    - Tracking changes to the course website becomes the process of tracking changes to the course.  This is a huge asset for knowledge management.
    - Github and Gitlab can serve as the repository of the site code as well as the (free) hosting solution 

### Limitations:

1. No user engagement (e.g., discussions, turning things in) on the site - this is a one-way street
2. Moderate learning curve to get started managing a site
