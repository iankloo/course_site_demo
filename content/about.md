## The Course: SE375 Statistics for Engineers

This course is an integral part of the Systems Engineering major that emphasizes both the statistical analyses of data and a statistical methodology important to systems analysis and design. The over-arching course goal is to develop cadets into critical consumers and providers of statistical information as it relates to the techniques, activities, and modeling applications that typify systems engineering concerns.. The course builds on the core probability and statistics course and introduces statistics applications fundamental to the design and analysis of simulations and engineering systems. Specific topics include point and interval estimation, parametric and non-parametric tests of hypotheses, analysis of variance, linear regression, and survey design of experiments, specifically analysis of power and determination of sample size. 

The course emphasizes the importance of knowing and understanding the assumptions associated with the use of inferential statistics as well as the usefulness of statistical software packages. The basic principles learned in this course will facilitate data analysis in support of Army acquisition and system redesign decision-making. Ethical implications in the analysis and presentation of experimental results, as well as interactions with decision makers, are addressed.
