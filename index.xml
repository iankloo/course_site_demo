      <description>The Course: SE375 Statistics for Engineers This course is an integral part of the Systems Engineering major that emphasizes both the statistical analyses of data and a statistical methodology important to systems analysis and design. The over-arching course goal is to develop cadets into critical consumers and providers of statistical information as it relates to the techniques, activities, and modeling applications that typify systems engineering concerns.. The course builds on the core probability and statistics course and introduces statistics applications fundamental to the design and analysis of simulations and engineering systems.</description>
