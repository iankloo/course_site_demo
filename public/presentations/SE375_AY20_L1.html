## Lectures

- Lectures are for you!

- I will try to present material in a way that you don't get in your textbook to give you another way to look at things

- I'll hit theory as quickly as possible and get to an example problem

- You'll see some code, but this won't be a "coding class"

- My style can (and probably will) change to meet the needs of this specific group - I'll need your feedback!

class: gray
## Class Basics

&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;

- Respect others: be on time, ready to learn (HW, Appropriate Materials, No Phones)
- No food, no drink (except approved containers - &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; Starbucks with a lid), no tobacco
- Coats and backpacks in the hallway
- If you need to leave early or miss a class, let me know via email
    - I cannot excuse you from missing class - I just record what happens
- It is your responsibility to reschedule WPR's 48 hours before they are given
- Primary means of communication are Teams and email
- AI - as often as you need, specific questions, come prepared
- Disputing grades
    - I make mistakes, so please correct me if you think you were graded incorrectly
    - &lt;strong&gt;Make all requests for grade disputes in writing&lt;/strong&gt;

## Tips to Succeed in SE375

- &lt;strong&gt;Remember (or relearn) what you did in MA206&lt;/strong&gt;
    - Classes are starting to build on each other - you have to retain knowledge!
- Prep before class
    - Coming to lectures and participating alone is not enough to succeed for most
- Re-write my code, don't copy/paste
    - This helps with retention
    - There isn't much code in this class
- Communicate with me early and often if you have any problems

&lt;strong&gt;I'm not interested in you "getting by" in this class. My job is to teach you statistics.  You will get a good grade if you learn statistics...and a bad one if you don't.&lt;/strong&gt;

class: gray
## Documentation Requirements

Source Document: DSE Policy Memo 1-3 "Academic Documentation Policy"

- Graded submissions require cover sheet/electronic acknowledgement
    - In-line documentation as necessary
- Common knowledge includes:
    - All DSE textbooks, course materials, anything on blackboard, discussions in class, discussions with your instructor
    - &lt;strong&gt;No need to document common knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;
    - &lt;strong&gt;This does NOT equate to good scholarship, but will save you from an honor violation&lt;/strong&gt;
- Assistance and collaboration
    - Properly, specifically documented assistance IAW and DAW Appendix A (p.21)
    - Collaboration is working together on a common project
- Best practices
    - When in doubt, document
    - Actively document sources while you're working - it's way to hard to go back and remember
- Citation style: APA

---

class: gray
## Assistance

&lt;strong&gt;Assistance Includes:&lt;/strong&gt; 
- Getting a verbal answer from another person about a specific point of confusion
- Having someone show you his/her solution so you know how to proceed on your own
- Having someone show you where the errors are in your own solution
- Having someone help you fix errors in your own solution
- Using previous semester's assignments in order to derive your own answer
- Having someone explain to you exactly what to type
- Using other electronic and non-electronic resources (e.g., websites)

&lt;strong&gt;This all needs to be specifically documented&lt;/strong&gt;

---

class: gray
## Assistance

.pull-left[
&lt;strong&gt;Good Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;
- You are doing the typing
- The person giving assistance is both present and knowledgeable
- The person giving assistance is successfully helping you understand the material
]

.pull-right[
&lt;strong&gt;Bad Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;
- Electronic copying
- Retyping someone else's solution with that person not present to explain the solution
- Reproducing someone else's solution without understanding the content
- Receiving an electronic file of someone else's work
]


---

class: gray
## Last Word on Honor Issues

- The honor system is cadet-run
- It is my responsibility to put anything that may be an honor issue to the honor system
- I don't decide if someone is guilty of an honor violation
- In my experience, the main issue is assistance - if you tell a different story in your assistance citation than another cadet, someone is wrong...and that may be an honor violation

&lt;strong&gt;In this class especially, it is very obvious if you copy someone's answer

---

class: gray
## Instructor Points

- There will be a reading quiz that you need to take before the start of (almost) every class

- I will post each quiz at least 24 hours before they are due and will blast a message on Teams - make sure your notifications are set accordingly

- I will drop your lowest 3 quizzes 

- &lt;strong&gt;You are responsible for quizzes even if you aren't in class&lt;/strong&gt;

- That's it!  I'm not holding you hostage with instructor points.  

    - If you don't participate in class, you will likely do poorly.  Trying to give/takeaway instructor points based on class participation or other intangibles introduces too much bias
    

---

class: gray
## "Homework"

- The syllabus has recommended homework problems for each class
- I am NOT collecting these
- I recommend using these to check on your own learning, and as potential AI problems
- I will publish complete solutions (not just answers) for all of them, as we go

## Review of Major Statistical Concepts

- If you failed or did poorly in MA206, this course will be very difficult - come see me early
- If you don't know the basics, learn them quick
    - Ex) you can't tell me what a P-value and a Z-score are, competently, by the first test, you will likely fail the class
- My goal is for everyone to pass this class, but &lt;strong&gt;I won't pass someone who doesn't know statistics&lt;/strong&gt;...that defeats the purpose of all of this
- If you can't do the level of statistics taught in this course, you should not be a systems engineer (not the end of the world)
- This class will be easier for those with aptitude, but anyone admitted to West Point can pass this class if they put in the work 

---

class: gray
## Why Should You Care?

- The foundation of machine learning and artificial intelligence is statistics
    - Even if you don't want to be a practitioner, you need to know how this works to be a leader
    - &lt;strong&gt;"Leaderology" is not sufficient in technical fields anymore&lt;/strong&gt;

- Logically thinking about the world requires statistics
    - PhD's in statistics are doctorates in philosophy - this is a way to think

- Most people don't understand statistics well enough to apply it.  As an engineer, you can't get by without it!

- Statistics is heavily tested on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FEE)

## Confidence Intervals

- Need average age of cows at USMA, but birthdays are PII...how can we estimate it?

- We could just ask everyone...
    1. Would take forever
    2. Maybe someone won't answer the survey
    
- We could ask a small number and estimate the mean of the &lt;font color='blue'&gt;population&lt;/font&gt; based on the mean of the &lt;font color='red'&gt;sample&lt;/font&gt;

- The &lt;font color='red'&gt;sample mean ( `\(\overline{x}\)` )&lt;/font&gt; will not exactly estimate &lt;font color='blue'&gt;population mean ( `\(\mu\)` ) &lt;/font&gt;, so we need to report a &lt;strong&gt;confidence interval&lt;/strong&gt;

---

class: gray
## Confidence Intervals

- General formula:

`$$\text{point estimate } \pm \text{ statistic }_\frac{\alpha}{2} * \text{standard error}$$`
    
- Point estimate = &lt;font color='red'&gt; `\(\overline{x}\)` &lt;/font&gt;
- Statistic:
    1. If `\(n \geq 30\)`, use a z-statistic
    2. If `\(n &lt; 30\)`, use a t-statistic 
- Standard Error:
    1. If you have &lt;font color='blue'&gt; `\(\sigma\)` &lt;/font&gt;, use `\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)`
    2. If you only have &lt;font color='red'&gt; `\(S\)` &lt;/font&gt;, use `\(\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\)` 

- Intuition:
    - Bigger standard error, bigger confidence interval
    - Smaller `\(n\)`, bigger confidence interval
    - Smaller `\(\alpha\)` bigger confidence interval 
---

class: gray
## Key Concept: Central Limit Theorem

- We can use z- and t-statistics because of the CLT

- No matter what your data looks like,
    - Take a bunch of samples and calculate the means
    - The distribution of these means (sampling distribution) will approach a normal distribution!
    
- So...if we take a sample and calculate the mean, we can use the normal distribution to say something about the population mean
    
- &lt;a href = https://gallery.shinyapps.io/CLT_mean/&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;

---

class: gray
## Confidence Intervals

- Using a z table (if `\(n \geq 30\)` --&gt; uses a normal distribution) 

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src = 'www/img/z_table.png' style = 'height: 450px'&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


---

class: gray
## Confidence Intervals

- Using a t table (if `\(n &lt; 30\)` --&gt; uses a modified, more conservative, distribution that is similar to the normal distribution)

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src = 'www/img/t_table.png' style = 'height: 450px'&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---


class: gray
## Confidence Intervals

- Interpreting CI's

- Ex) 95% CI
    - If we repeatedly take samples of the population and calculate the mean, the population mean will fall within our calculated CI 95% of the time
    - OK to interpret in plain language as "there is a 95% chance the population mean is within this range"
    
- What we can't say:
    - How close the population and sample means likely are
    - Anything meaningful about the population or sample distributions other than the means of both

- This helps: https://rpsychologist.com/d3/CI/

## Confidence Intervals: Practice Problem

- Want to know the age of the average cow at USMA, but don't have time to ask everyone

- You asked 50 cadets and got the following information:
    - Mean: 20
    - Standard Deviation (of sample): 3
    
- Use this information to create and interpret a 95% confidence interval to say something about the mean of all USMA cows

## Confidence Intervals: Practice Problem - Coded Solution


```r
z_stat &lt;- qnorm(.025, lower.tail = FALSE)
st_error &lt;- 3 / (sqrt(50)) 
upper &lt;- 20 + (z_stat * st_error)
lower &lt;- 20 - (z_stat * st_error)

upper
```

```
## [1] 20.83154
```

```r
lower
```

```
## [1] 19.16846
```


- With 95% confidence, we state the mean age of cows is between 20.8315423 and 19.1684577

- There is a 5% chance the true mean age is not within our CI
