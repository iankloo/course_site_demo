#---Baseball Exercise

#-1) read in the data

#-2) Use ggpairs() to figure out if any regressors are collinear

#-3) Create a model to predict wins using runs scored, runs agianst, on-base percentage, sluggin percentage, and batting average

#-4) Use the variance inflation factor to test for multicollinearity

#-5) Print your model's summary and analyze the significance of the coefficients, the model utility test, and the R^2 value

#-6) Check your residual assumptions

#-7) Remove and regressors that might be causing multicollinarity problems and rebuild your model

#-8) Analyze your new model (hint, you should be down to 4 regressors at this point)

#-9) Check your new model's assumptions

#-10) Remove any insignificant regressors from your model and rebuild

#-11) Check the final model's assumptions

#-12) Check for outliers using standardized residuals

#-13) Check for influential points using Cook's Distance

#-14) How is your final model?  Would you use it?
